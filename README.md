# hello-world
baby's first repository!
I am brand new to all of this! I feel like a lil sponge. Everything about coding, github, languages, etc. all feels so new and foreign to me. I'm entering another universe and it's exciting!!! I can't wait to reflect in a few months/a year and see how much I learned, and how many gaps in my knowledge are bridged between now and then!!
